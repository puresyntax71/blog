      <description>PHP I originally used the PHP package bundled with OS X. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be easily maintainable since you would have an outdated PHP version. I&amp;rsquo;ve since replaced this with homebrew-php specifically the package php54.
Note: If you&amp;rsquo;ve added some configurations in PHP which is most likely located at /etc/php.ini, you might want to copy the custom configurations over to your new PHP ini location which is /usr/local/etc/php/5.4/php.ini in my case.</description>

      <title>PHP 5.4 and PHPDBG in OS X</title>

      <description>I got PHPDBG enabled in PHP 5.4 although I&amp;rsquo;ve never bothered giving it a try. Recently, I decided to play around with it to try to compare it with Xdebug. I tested it with a minimal Drupal installation.
Installation PHP and PHPDBG I use homebrew-php to install PHP 5.4. Versions 5.4+ have the flag --with-phpdbg if you wish to include PHPDBG during installation therefore installation is simply via invoking brew install php54 --with-phpdbg.</description>
